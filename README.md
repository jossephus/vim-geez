# vim-keymaps for geez
"I like taking notes in [Tigirgna] and there was no powergeez or other [geez keyboard] app I could use for Linux. The solution would have been to create a geez keyboard sw or to use VIM. By Principle, If you could avoid gui for terminal, always choose terminal. So, this plugin was born"

- This Plugin was Generated using Geezify, an in house english-geez word converting cli [ might add link when I push it to github].

## Install
```vimscript
    " using Vundle
    Plugin 'jossephus/vim-geez'
```
### after installing 
u can turn on geez in vim by
```
	set keymap = geez
```
